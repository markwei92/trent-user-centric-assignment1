    <h2>Chinese Chess Overview</h2>
    <p>Chinese chess is relatively similar to international chess in the sense that it has the knight, rook, pawns and the king. And thats pretty much where the similarity ends, in chinese chess, the objective is the same to capture the king. The board consists 5 pawns, 2 cannons, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops and a king. The pawns can only move forward along the lines, until they cross
    the enemy's side of the river, in which they are now allowed to move horizontally one line spacing per turn. Unlike in regular chess, the pawn cannot move backwards even if it reaches the end of the board, neither does it change to any special piece, so use the pawns wisely for once they reach the end, they are only left with the option of left or right. The rest of the pieces work the same way apart from the cannon which is the piece that makes the game drastically different from regular chess.
    The cannon must jump over a piece to capture it, it moves like a rook but the trick is it cannot capture the piece in front of it but rather the piece behind the piece in front of it. This interesting mechanics allow for a very unique and fast paced style of play, and pawns in this game are less impactful and fewer in numbers allowing for much quicker play as more powerful pieces are able to move out faster and onto the field ready to strike.

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>This game is played by many around the world, its a highly popular, easy to learn and strategic game, similar to international chess but it is alot more fast paced as the pawns play a less important role as a buffer and usually pieces like the rook, knight and the cannon are the main fighting pieces for the majority of the game, whereas the pawn is moved very situationally and for the most part remains at the same spot for most of the game. As you have seen from the video demo, some pieces like the knight and elephant
        can be blocked by other adjacent pieces, this also adds to the variation and difficulty of the game as the player have to find ways around such situations. For those who enjoy international chess or deep strategical battles, this game is most certainly a must try, its a one of a kind game that is easy to learn hard to master and thats what makes it fun and replayable.</p>
