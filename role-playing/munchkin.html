    <h2>Munchkin Overview</h2>
    <p>Munchkin is a dungeon and dragons type of game whereby you start of as a human and using the cards you draw  you can customize your class as a warrior, wizard or other classes depending on the cards you draw or choose to play.
    Players start with 7 cards and at any turn they can start placing cards onto their field such as weapons, armour, class and race (yes you can be an elf or dwalf). At each turn players will kick down the door, and if  you kick open a monster card, you have to fight it, winning the monster with your levels and combined items.
    Your opponents can also choose to help you by combining their levels in exchange for some or all of the loots shown on the monster card, but the level will be exclusive to the player who kicked the door. Likewise, opponents can help the monster instead using action cards and cause you to lose and receive the bad stuff which is also on
    the monster card. When you win you take the treasure, pick up another card and the turn is passed onto the next player. If you have no monster when you kick the door, you can choose to play your own monster card in your hand if you have any. The first to reach level 10 wins the game.</p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>This game is relatively fun and easy to learn, theres a great amount of interaction with one another making it similar to a family type game but it also has elements of customization and the option to work with or against a particular player, heck you can even work as a team together to kill the monster and win the game together.
        Thats the craziness of this game as it does not take winning too seriously and really allows for alot of variation in the gameplay and even the rulebook allows you to tweak some of the rules as you see fit to make the game fun. So overall it is certainly fun to play, but it does get a little repetitive after a while and it is very likely you
        will have to buy more expansions to keep the game interesting, the expansions are numerous and the cards are pretty wacky as well, each having very different effects from all the other card expansions. It can cause some imbalances in the gameplay, but hey thats the fun of it, winning is not the main objective but having a good time is.</p>
