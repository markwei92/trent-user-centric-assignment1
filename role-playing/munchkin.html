    <p>Dixit is a game of storytelling and imagination, each player will be given 6 cards at the start of the round. All the cards are picture cards, the objective of the game is simple,  be the first to win 30 points. Each turn a player will take turns to be the storyteller, telling a story based on the card they intend to play. The rest will pick a card from their hand which they think most suit the story and pass it to the storyteller to shuffle.
    After all the cards are collected, the storyteller shuffles and lay out the cards for the rest to choose, each with a token placed on the card they think is the storyteller's. They are not allowed to vote for their own card, the ones who chose the storyteller's cards gets 3 points while the rest gets none. The game is played till one person reaches 30 points first to win.</p>
