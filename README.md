# trent-user-centric-assignment1

This is my assignment for User Centric Module.

#UI/UX

This is a blog for board games that allows the user to search for board games that they may be
interested or are curious about. The blog is filtered by categories, family, role-playing and strategic each
have their own unique selling point. For each of these categories there are a list of games with a summary to enable
users to quickly determine whether they would be interested to read further.

By clicking through the various filters and looking at the game and its review, the user will get a comprehensive understanding
of how the game works. At the top will be a brief summary what the game is about followed by a demo video on how to play followed by
a personal review and finally a link on where to buy. I have attached the excel file for my strategy and scope that governs the 
framework for the building of the blog site under "Assignment 1 Strat & Scope.xlsx".

#Features
The site is fairly simple to navigate, you can use the tabs above or the carousel on the homepage, each will bring to their own category,
for each category I have done up a full review page for the first game only.

#Technologies Used
HTML and CSS with Bootstrap framework

#Testing
Did the testing by clicking through each tab as well as carousel to ensure the links are working properly. The newsletter links are dummy links and are just displayed
to make it look complete. Videos and buttons are all working after manual testing individually. The logo icon above is tested as well to ensure
that it brings you back to the homepage.

#Deployment
Deployed on github all files
To run code just extract all the files onto a coding text editor and run the index.html file. 

#Credits

-Inspiration from class brainstorm session

-Apart from video which is from youtube, all review content and overview are self-generated as I have experience playing the games and this is my
own personal writings and experience with the games.
