  <h2>What you need to know</h2>

  <p>
    There are 2 main types of tabletop game, our classic board games and the portable card games, with plenty of variations which game should you buy? Heres where we come in to help, 
    there are 3 important criterias that make a good game, we will go over each in detail. 
  </p>
   
   <p>
    Firstly, the learning curve criteria, meaning how easy is it to learn and get the ball rolling,
    are there many roadblocks to playing the game and is there a constant need to refer back to the game manual on the first few rounds of the game.</p>
  <p>
     Secondly, there is the strategic depth criteria, meaning
    how much thinking is required in the game, is it a game with some simple mechanics like the use of a dice in decision making with very little thinking involved or a more complex game where there is more considerations are needed to
    make a decision.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lastly, we have the replayability criteria which determines how much replay value is in the game, does it get boring quickly or does it spark joy with every game that is played, is it interesting
    with alot of unique mechanics or is it relatively straight forward with more focus on luck than on a players ability.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Again all these 3 criterias are by no means comprehensive but this should be a good guideline for what makes a good tabletop 
    game. More complex games tend to take longer to learn with a harder learning curve but have greater strategic depth and more replayability, its not always the case but a general rule of thumb when talking about such games. And likewise
    simpler games focus on getting the ball rolling quickly while sacrificing on strategic depth but replayability may vary depending on the kind of outcomes as some may prefer elements of suspense, while others may prefer skills or something they can
    benchmark in order to find the game interesting. There are plenty of outliers as well, and in the review section you will find a game that will suit everyone's taste. With that, happy review hunting and I hope you find the game you are looking for.
